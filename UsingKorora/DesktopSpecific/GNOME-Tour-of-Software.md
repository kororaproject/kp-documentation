# Tour of GNOME Software ("I Need a Program That Does This")

One of the core aims of the Korora Project is to provide an out-of-box Linux experience that can take care of the average's users daily needs with entirely free software. To save you the trouble of digging through every preinstalled application, we have compiled a list of the prepackaged applications within each version of Korora that fulfill a specific purpose. This will hopefully save you some trouble from immediately downloading more software when the right tool may already be installed.

The GNOME desktop pulls all of its packages from [The GNOME Project](https://www.gnome.org/), its maintainers. These programs are usually built in-house and do not pull "upstream" from anywhere else.

On top of this, there are additional packages added by Korora.
