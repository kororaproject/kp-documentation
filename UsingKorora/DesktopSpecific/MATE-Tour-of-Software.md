# Tour of MATE Software ("I Need a Program That Does This")

One of the core aims of the Korora Project is to provide an out-of-box Linux experience that can take care of the average's users daily needs with entirely free software. To save you the trouble of digging through every preinstalled application, we have compiled a list of the prepackaged applications within each version of Korora that fulfill a specific purpose. This will hopefully save you some trouble from immediately downloading more software when the right tool may already be installed.

The MATE Desktop largely uses GNOME applications for its inventory of existing programs. However, as MATE is itself a fork of GNOME 2, MATE maintains several forks of GNOME apps in order to better maintain their aesthetic within the classic GNOME 2/desktop paradigm. These include MATE's own Image Viewer and Document Viewer, based on upstream GNOME programs.

On top of this, there are additional packages added by Korora.
